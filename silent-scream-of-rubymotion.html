<h1>Silent scream of RubyMotion</h1>

<p>As you probably already noticed we have <a href="http://www.rubyflow.com/users/FluffyJack" rel="nofollow" >one user</a> that is constantly posting something about RubyMotion. Usually I have nothing against promotion of products on RubyFlow from time to time, but in this case we're talking about posting <b>10 posts within just 30 days</b>, which is on average post every second work-day. I would call it <b>SPAM</b>.

<p>Before writing this note I decided to do some research regarding those posts and product that is marketed, so I wouldn't be accused of being biased.</p>

<p>Since December 2013 he posted <b>57 messages</b> (average of two posts per week for over half year), out of which more than half was links to his screencasts behind paywall, and remaining ones was to his blog. <b>Not a single</b> post about RubyMotion was made by other user.</p>

<p>I partially understand why his so vocal - his tweets are reposted <a href="https://twitter.com/RubyMotionTV/status/480932438332284928" rel="nofollow" >three</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/RubyMotionTV/status/483395642312503296" rel="nofollow" >times</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/RubyMotionTV/status/486087871099445248" rel="nofollow" >on average</a>, which would suggest that <b>nobody really care</b>. With higher average I could say it's popular topic and need proper attention - but it looks like even Twitter followers ignore it. Because of that he's so desperate that we writes <a href="http://www.rubyflow.com/items/11116-why-swift-will-never-replace-rubymotion" rel="nofollow" >time</a> after <a href="http://www.rubyflow.com/items/11169-swift-still-won-t-replace-rubymotion" rel="nofollow" >time</a> after <a href="http://www.rubyflow.com/items/11275-should-you-learn-rubymotion-or-swift" rel="nofollow" >time</a> that RubyMotion is better than Swift. It might be even true (although judging from comparison of number of StackOverflow tickets over two years I doubt it) but such way of marketing might only be called <b>desperate</b>.</p>

<p>As a final note I would like to ask for two things. First is for FluffyJack to post less often. I would gladly hear about RubyMotion once or twice per year, but not per week. On the other side it would be nice to see RubyFlow users a little more vocal about spam - please <b>don't use silent treatment</b> when somebody else is buying Google position and free traffic using our community.</p>
